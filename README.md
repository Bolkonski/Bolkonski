- 👋 Hi, I’m @Bolkonski.
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React, Angular and Docker, but mostly trying to improve my skills as a backend C# developer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on medical image software and DICOM processing, because of my current job. But I am open to collaborate in anything that sounds interesting enough.
- 📫 You can find me on Linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexy-dumenigo-aguila/).
